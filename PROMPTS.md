## üí¨ Financial Assistant Chat Prompts

### System Prompt for Financial Questions

**Model**: `@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`

**Location**: `src/simple-agent.ts` (lines 2434-2444)

**Prompt**:
```
You are a personal finance assistant. The user has:
- Balance: $[BALANCE]
- Income: $[TOTAL_INCOME]
- Expenses: $[TOTAL_EXPENSES]
- Top spending: [TOP_3_CATEGORIES_WITH_AMOUNTS]

Answer their specific question using this data. Keep responses under 150 words and be specific.
```

**Purpose**: 
- Provides context-aware financial assistance
- Uses real-time user financial data
- Generates personalized advice based on spending patterns
- Answers questions like "How much did I spend?" or "What's my balance?"

**Example Interactions**:
```
User: "How much did I spend in September?"
Context: Balance: $1,250.75, Expenses: $1,847.23, Top: food $450.00, housing $800.00, transportation $250.00

AI Response: "In September, you spent $1,847.23 across your transactions. Your highest spending was in housing at $800.00, followed by food at $450.00. You're currently maintaining a balance of $1,250.75."
```

**Fallback Response**:
When AI fails, the system generates an intelligent fallback using actual financial data:
```
Based on your financial data: You currently have a balance of $[BALANCE]. You've spent $[TOTAL_EXPENSES] across [TRANSACTION_COUNT] transactions. Your highest spending category is [TOP_CATEGORY] at $[AMOUNT]. [HEALTH_INDICATOR]
```

## üì∏ Receipt Vision Scanning Prompts

### Primary Vision Prompt (Detailed Extraction)

**Model**: `@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` (multimodal)

**Location**: `src/simple-agent.ts` (lines 2786-2804)

**Prompt**:
```
Extract information from this receipt image and return ONLY a JSON object with this exact format:
{
  "amount": 0.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "merchant": "Store Name",
  "date": "2025-01-01",
  "category": "food",
  "confidence": 0.95
}

Instructions:
- amount: Extract the TOTAL or GRAND TOTAL (including tax). Use decimal format (e.g., 45.67).
- currency: Detect from $ symbol (USD), ‚Ç¨ (EUR), ¬£ (GBP), or text.
- merchant: Store/business name from the top of the receipt.
- date: Convert to YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 12/25/2024 becomes 2025-12-25).
- category: Choose ONE from: food, transportation, housing, entertainment, shopping, healthcare, other
- confidence: Your confidence level from 0 to 1.

Return ONLY the JSON object. No explanations, no markdown, no code blocks.
```

**Purpose**:
- Extracts structured data from receipt images
- Converts human-readable dates to ISO format
- Categorizes transactions automatically
- Provides confidence scores for validation

**Input**: Base64-encoded image (JPG, PNG, etc.)

**Expected Output**:
```json
{
  "amount": 45.67,
  "currency": "USD",
  "merchant": "Whole Foods Market",
  "date": "2024-09-15",
  "category": "food",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```

### Fallback Vision Prompt (Simplified)

**Model**: `@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` (multimodal)

**Location**: `src/simple-agent.ts` (line 2833)

**Prompt**:
```
Look at this receipt. Extract: total amount, store name, date, and what category (food/shopping/etc). Return as JSON: {"amount": 0, "merchant": "", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "category": "food", "currency": "USD", "confidence": 1}. JSON only, no other text.
```

**Purpose**:
- Simplified extraction when primary prompt fails
- More concise instructions for better success rate
- Used as retry mechanism for difficult receipts

**Retry Strategy**:
1. First attempt: Detailed prompt with full instructions
2. Second attempt (if JSON parsing fails): Simplified prompt
3. Natural language parsing as last resort

## üéØ Prompt Engineering Techniques Used

### 1. **Structured Output Formatting**
- Explicitly request JSON format
- Provide exact schema with example values
- Specify "JSON only, no other text" to avoid markdown wrapping

### 2. **Context Injection**
- Include user's current balance, income, expenses
- Add top spending categories for relevance
- Provide month-specific transaction data

### 3. **Fallback Strategies**
- Multiple prompt variations (detailed ‚Üí simplified)
- JSON extraction from markdown code blocks
- Natural language parsing as last resort
- Intelligent fallback responses using real data

### 4. **Response Constraints**
- "Keep responses under 150 words" for chat
- "Return ONLY JSON object" for structured data
- Specific format requirements (YYYY-MM-DD dates)

### 5. **Vision Model Optimization**
- Clear field-by-field instructions
- Examples for each field (e.g., "45.67" for amounts)
- Category constraints (predefined list)
- Currency detection from symbols

## üìù Prompt Best Practices Learned

1. **Be Explicit**: "Return ONLY JSON" works better than "Return JSON"
2. **Provide Examples**: Show exact format with realistic values
3. **Constrain Outputs**: Limit categories to predefined lists
4. **Layer Fallbacks**: Have 2-3 retry strategies
5. **Inject Context**: Real user data makes responses more relevant
6. **Test Edge Cases**: Receipts with tax, tips, discounts, foreign currencies
7. **Set Expectations**: "Keep under 150 words" prevents verbose responses
